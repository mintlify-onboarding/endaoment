Section 4.4 Notice. Whenever the Member is required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given under this Section, to the Member. The notice shall specify the place, date, and hour of the meeting, and the means of electronic transmission by and to this corporation or electronic video screen communication, if any, by which the Member may participate in the meeting.

The transactions of any meetings of the membership, however called or notice and wherever held, shall be as valid as though taken at a meeting duly held after standard call and notice, if the Member is present at the meeting unless the Member objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting was not lawfully called or convened. Also, attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters required to be included in the notice of the meeting but not so included, if that objection is expressly made at the meeting.

## ARTICLE V: Directors

Section 5.1 Powers of Directors. Subject to the provisions and limitations of the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law and any other applicable laws, and subject to any limitations of the Articles and these Bylaws, the activities and affairs of this corporation shall be conducted and all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the Board. The Board may delegate the management of the activities of this corporation to any person or persons, management company or committees, however composed, provided that the activities and affairs of this corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised under the ultimate direction of the Board. Without prejudice to such general powers, but subject to the same limitations, the Board shall have the power to do the following:

(a) Select and remove, at the pleasure of the Board, all officers, agents, and employees of this corporation; prescribe powers and duties for them as may not be inconsistent with the law, the Articles or these Bylaws; fix their compensation; and require from them security for faithful service;

(b) Change the principal office or the principal business office of this corporation in California from one location to another; cause this corporation to be qualified to conduct its activities in any other state, territory, dependency, or country; and conduct its activities in or outside California;

(c) Conduct, manage, and control the affairs and activities of this corporation and make such rules and regulations for these purposes, not inconsistent with law, the Articles, or these Bylaws, as the Board deems appropriate;

(d) Borrow money and incur indebtedness on this corporation’s behalf, and cause to be executed and delivered for this corporation’s purposes, in the corporate name, promissory notes, bonds, debentures, deeds of trust, mortgages, pledges, hypothecations, or other evidences of debt and securities; and

(e) Adopt and use a corporate seal, and alter the form of such seal from time to time as the Board deems appropriate.

Section 5.2 Standard of Care. A Director shall perform the duties of a Director, including duties as a member of any Board committee, in good faith, in a manner that the Director believes to be in the best interests of this corporation and with such care, including reasonable inquiry, as an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. In performing the duties of a Director, a Director shall be entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports, or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, in each case prepared or presented by:

(a) One or more officers or employees of this corporation whom the Director believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented;

(b) Counsel, independent accountants or other persons as to matters which the Director believes to be within that person’s professional or expert competence; or

(c) A committee upon which the Director does not serve that is composed exclusively of any or any combination of Directors and persons described in subsection (a) and (b) of this Section as to matters within the committee’s designated authority, which committee the Director believes to merit confidence, so long as, in any case, the Director acts in good faith, after reasonable inquiry when the need therefor is indicated by the circumstances and without knowledge that would cause that reliance to be unwarranted.

Section 5.3 Number of Directors. The authorized number of Directors shall consist of at least three but no more than ten Directors, until changed by amendment to these Bylaws. The exact number of authorized Directors shall be fixed, within those limits, by a resolution adopted by the Board.

Section 5.4 Selection and Term of Office. Directors shall be elected at an annual meeting of the membership. Each Director shall serve for a term of approximately two years and shall continue to serve until a successor Director has been elected and qualified, unless the Director has resigned or been removed from office.

Section 5.5 Nominations of Directors. The Board may nominate qualified candidates for election to the Board at least 30 days before the date of any election of Directors. The Member may also nominate qualified candidates for election to the Board at any time.

Section 5.6 Qualifications of Board Members. Any person 18 years of age or older whose interests align with the purposes of this corporation may be elected to serve as a Director.

Section 5.7 Restriction on Interested Directors. Not more than 49 percent of the persons serving on the Board at any one time may be interested persons as that term is defined below. An “interested person” is (a) any person currently being compensated by this corporation for services rendered to it within the previous 12 months, whether as a full-time or part-time employee, independent contractor or otherwise, excluding any reasonable compensation paid to a Director for services he or she provided in her or her capacity as a Director and (b) any brother, sister, ancestor, descendant, spouse, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, mother-in-law or father-in-law of any person described in clause (a). Any violation of the provisions of this paragraph shall not, however, affect the validity or enforceability of any transaction entered into by this corporation.

Section 5.8 Vacancies, Resignations, and Removal.

(a) A vacancy or vacancies in the Board shall be deemed to exist in case of (i) the death, resignation, or removal of any Director; (ii) the declaration by resolution of the Board of a vacancy in the office of a Director who has been declared of unsound mind by a final order of court, been convicted of a felony, or been found by a final order or judgment of any court to have breached any duty arising under Chapter 2, Article 3 of the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law; (iii) the vote of the Member to remove any Director(s); (iv) the increase of the authorized number of Directors; or (v) a failure of the Member, at any meeting of membership at which any Director or Directors are to be elected, to elect the full authorized number of Directors.

(b) Except as provided herein, any Director may resign by giving written notice to the Chair of the Board (if there be such an officer), the President, or the Secretary. The resignation shall be effective when the notice is given unless it specifies a later time at which it will become effective. If the resignation is to become effective at a later time, the Board may elect a successor Director before such time, to take office as of the date when the resignation becomes effective. Except on notice to the California Attorney General, no Director may resign if, by doing so, this corporation would be left without a duly elected Director or Directors.

(c) Any Director may be removed, with or without cause, by approval of the Member. A Director may be removed by the Board only with cause. Any vacancy caused by the removal of a Director shall be filled as provided in Section 5.8(d). The office of any Director who was elected after the date of adoption of these Bylaws who does not attend three successive Board meetings may be declared vacant and the Director removed from office by Board resolution unless (i) the Director requests a leave of absence for a limited period of time, and the leave is approved by the Board at a regular or special meeting (if such leave is granted, the number of Directors will be reduced by one in determining whether a quorum is or is not present during the period of leave); or (ii) the Director suffers from an illness, disability, or special circumstance that prevents him or her from attending meetings and the Board by resolution waives the removal procedure set forth in this subsection. Any Director who has been removed from the Board pursuant to the procedure set forth in the preceding sentence may only be reinstated as a Director by resolution of the majority of Directors then in office.

(d) Except for a vacancy created by the removal of a Director by the Member, vacancies in the Board may be filled by approval of the Board or by a sole remaining Director if only one Director remains. Each Director so selected to fill a vacancy in the Board shall hold office until the expiration of the term of the Director whom he or she replaced and shall continue to serve until a successor has been elected and qualified. The Member may elect a Director or Director at any time to fill any vacancy or vacancies not filled by the Board.

(e) No reduction of the authorized number of Directors shall have the effect of removing any Director prior to the expiration of the Director’s term of office.

Section 5.9 Rights of Inspection. Each Director shall have the absolute right at any reasonable time to inspect and copy all books, records, and documents of every kind and to inspect the physical properties of this corporation. The inspection may be made by the Director in person or by the Director’s agent or attorney.

Section 5.10 Fees and Compensation. Directors may receive such compensation, if any, for their services as Directors, officers or members of Board committees, and such reimbursement of expenses, as the Board may establish by resolution to be just and reasonable as to this corporation at the time that the resolution is adopted.

Section 5.11 Approval of Executive Compensation. The Board (or authorized Board committee) shall review and approve the compensation, including benefits, of the President or chief executive officer and of the Treasurer to assure that such compensation is just and reasonable and given in return for services actually rendered to this corporation. This review and approval shall occur upon the hiring of the officer, whenever the officer’s term of employment (if any) is renewed or extended, and whenever the officer’s compensation is modified (unless the modification extends to substantially all employees).

## ARTICLE VI: Meetings of the Board

Section 6.1 Place of Meeting. Meetings of the Board shall be held at any place that has been designated from time to time by the Board. In the absence of such designation, regular meetings shall be held virtually via Zoom, Facetime, Google Meet, Discord, or other similar service. When an on chain vote is conducted (as described in Section 6.6), it shall be time bound to align with the virtual meeting of the board, and the time period when voting is open shall be considered a meeting of the Board.

Section 6.2 Annual Meetings. The Board shall hold an annual meeting for the purpose of organization, the selection of Directors (when required by these Bylaws) and officers, and the transaction of other business. Annual meetings of the Board shall be held without call or notice on such date and at such time as is fixed by the Board.

Section 6.3 Regular Meetings. Regular meetings, in addition to the annual meeting, of the Board may be held without call or notice on such dates and at such times as may be fixed from time to time by the Board.

Any such notice shall be addressed or delivered to each Director at such Director’s address, phone number, facsimile number, or electronic mail address as it is shown upon the records of this corporation or as may have been given to this corporation by the Director for purposes of notice or, if such address is not shown on such records or is not readily ascertainable, at the place in which the meetings of the Board are regularly held.

(c) Notice of a special meeting sent by first-class mail shall be deposited in the United States mails at least four days before the time set for the meeting. Notice of a special meeting given personally or by telephone, facsimile, electronic transmission or other similar means of communication, shall be delivered, telephoned, or otherwise sent, as appropriate, at least 48 hours before the time set for the meeting.

(d) Notice of a special meeting shall state the time and date of the meeting and the place, if the place is other than this corporation’s principal office. The notice need not specify the purpose of the meeting.

Section 6.5 Quorum. A majority of the number of Directors then in office constitutes a quorum of the Board for the transaction of business, except to adjourn as provided in Section 6.10 of these Bylaws. However, under no circumstances shall a quorum be less than the greater of (a) one-fifth of the number of authorized Directors, or (b) two. Every action taken or decision made by a majority of the Directors present at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present shall be regarded as the act of the Board, except as otherwise set forth in these Bylaws and subject to the more stringent provisions of the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law, including, without limitation, those provisions relating to (a) approval of contracts or transactions in which a Director has a direct or indirect material financial interest, (b) creation of and appointments to committees of the Board and (c) indemnification of Directors. A meeting at which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal of any Director(s) from that meeting, if any action taken is approved by at least a majority, or such higher standard as is required by these Bylaws or by the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation law, of the required quorum for such meeting.

Section 6.6 Voting. Each Director present shall be entitled to one vote on each matter placed before a meeting. No Director may vote by proxy. Directors will in certain cases be required to vote in an onchain environment using their privileged Ethereum wallets. When onchain voting is required, they shall be time bound in a manner determined solely by the Chair of the Board, in conjunction with a virtual meeting of the Board.

Section 6.7 Participation in Meetings by Conference Telephone and other remote means. Directors may participate in a meeting through use of conference telephone, electronic video screen communication, or electronic transmission including blockchain votes. Participation in a meeting through use of conference telephone or electronic video screen communication constitutes presence in person at that meeting as long as all Directors participating in such meeting are able to hear one another. Participation in a meeting through use of electronic transmission by or to this corporation, other than conference telephone and electronic video screen communication, constitutes presence in person at that meeting if each Director can communicate with all of the other Directors concurrently during the meeting or voting time frame and each Director is provided the means of participating in all matters before the Board, including, without limitation, the capacity to propose, or to interpose an objection to, a specific action to be taken by this corporation.

Section 6.8 Waiver of Notice. Notice of a meeting need not be given to any Director who, either before or after the meeting, provides a signed waiver of notice; signs a written consent to the holding of the meeting or an approval of the minutes of the meeting; or attends the meeting without protesting, prior thereto or at its commencement, the lack of notice to him or her. Any such waiver of notice does not need to specify the purpose of the meeting. All such waivers, consents, and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meetings.

Section 6.9 Action Without Meeting. Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Board may be taken without a meeting, if all Directors shall consent, individually or collectively, in writing to such action. A Director may give consent in writing via electronic mail if the electronic mail is under the sole control of the Director using it. Such action by written consent shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote of the Board and the written consent or consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the Board. For purposes of this Section only, “all Directors” shall not include any “interested director” as defined in Section 5233 of the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law or a “common director” as described in Section 5234 of the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law who abstains in writing from providing consent, when (i) the facts described in Section 5233(d)(1) or (d)(2) are established or the provisions of Section 5234(a) are satisfied, as appropriate, at or before the execution of the written consent or consents; (ii) the establishment of those facts or satisfaction of those provisions is included in the written consent or consents executed by the noninterested or noncommon directors or in other records of this corporation; and (iii) the noninterested or noncommon directors approve the action by a vote that is sufficient without counting the votes of the interested directors or common directors.

Section 6.10 Adjournment. A majority of the Directors present, whether or not a quorum is present, may adjourn any meeting of the Board to another time and place. Notice of the time and place of holding an adjourned meeting need not be given to absent Directors if the time and place be fixed at the meeting adjourned, except as provided in the next sentence. If the meeting is adjourned for more than 24 hours, notice of any adjournment to another time or place shall be given prior to the time of the adjourned meeting to the Directors who were not present at the time of the adjournment. At the adjourned meeting, the Board may transact any business that may have been transacted at the original meeting.

Section 6.11 Conduct of Meetings. Meetings of the Board shall be presided over by the Chair of the Board, or, if there is no Chair of the Board or the Chair of the Board is absent, the President or, if the President and Chair of the Board are both absent, by the Vice President (if there be such an officer) or, in the absence of each of these persons, by a chairperson of the meeting, chosen by a majority of the Directors present at the meeting. The Secretary shall, if present, assure that minutes of any meeting of the Board are recorded and maintained. Meetings shall be governed by rules of procedure as may be determined by the Board from time to time, insofar as such rules are not inconsistent with or in conflict with these Bylaws, with the Articles, or with any provisions of law applicable to this corporation.

## ARTICLE VII: Committees

Section 7.1 Board Committees. The Board, by resolution adopted by a majority of the Directors then in office, may create one or more committees, each consisting of two or more Directors and no one who is not a Director, to serve at the pleasure of the Board.

The Board may appoint one or more Directors as alternate members of any such committee, who may replace any absent member at any meeting. Any member of any committee may be removed, with or without cause, at any time by the Board.

## ARTICLE IX: Indemnification

Section 9.1 Definitions. For the purposes of this Article IX, “agent” means any person who is or was a Director, officer, employee, or other agent of this corporation, or is or was serving at the request of this corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of a foreign or domestic corporation which was a predecessor corporation of this corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation; “proceeding” means any threatened, pending, or completed action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative; and “expenses” includes, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and any expenses of establishing a right to indemnification under Sections 9.4 or 9.5(b) of these Bylaws.

Section 9.2 Indemnification in Actions by Third Parties. This corporation shall, to the maximum extent of the law, indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any proceeding (other than an action by or in the right of this corporation to procure a judgment in its favor, an action brought under Section 5233 of the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law, or an action brought by the Attorney General or a person granted relator status by the Attorney General for any breach of duty relating to assets held in charitable trust), by reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of this corporation, against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with such proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the best interests of this corporation and, in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct of such person was unlawful. The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in the best interests of this corporation or that the person had reasonable cause to believe that the person's conduct was unlawful.

Section 9.3 Indemnification in Actions by or in the Right of this Corporation. This corporation shall, to the maximum extent of the law, indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action by or in the right of this corporation, or brought under Section 5233 of the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law, or brought by the Attorney General or a person granted relator status by the Attorney General for breach of duty relating to assets held in charitable trust, to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of this corporation, against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action if such person acted in good faith, in a manner such person believed to be in the best interests of this corporation, and with such care, including reasonable inquiry, as an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. No indemnification shall be made under this Section:

(a) In respect of any claim, issue, or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to this corporation in the performance of such person’s duty to this corporation, unless and only to the extent that the court in which such proceeding is or was pending shall determine upon application that, in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for the expenses which such court shall determine;

(b) Of amounts paid in settling or otherwise disposing of a threatened or pending action, with or without court approval; or

(c) Of expenses incurred in defending a threatened or pending action which is settled or otherwise disposed of without court approval, unless it is settled with the approval of the Attorney General.

Section 9.4 Indemnification Against Expenses. To the extent that an agent of this corporation has been successful on the merits in defense of any proceeding referred to in Section 9.2 or 9.3 of these Bylaws or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, the agent shall be indemnified against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the agent in connection therewith.

Section 9.5 Required Determination. Except as provided in Section 9.4 of these Bylaws, any indemnification under this Article IX shall be made by this corporation only if authorized in the specific case, upon a determination that indemnification of the agent is proper in the circumstances because the agent has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 9.2 or 9.3 of these Bylaws by:

(a) A majority vote of a quorum consisting of Directors who are not parties to such proceeding;

(b) Approval of the Member, with the persons to be indemnified not being entitled to vote thereon; or

(c) The court in which such proceeding is or was pending upon application made by this corporation or the agent or the attorney or other person rendering services in connection with the defense, whether or not such application by the agent, attorney, or other person is opposed by this corporation.

Section 9.6 Advance of Expenses. Expenses incurred by a person seeking indemnification under this Article IX in defending any proceeding covered by Article IX may be advanced by this corporation prior to the final disposition of such proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the agent to repay such amount unless it shall be determined ultimately that the agent is entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this Article IX.

Section 9.7 Other Indemnification. No provision made by this corporation to indemnify its or its subsidiary’s directors or officers for the defense of any proceeding, whether contained in the Articles, these Bylaws, a resolution of the Member or Directors, an agreement, or otherwise, shall be valid unless consistent with this Article IX. Nothing contained in this Article IX shall affect any right to indemnification to which persons other than such Directors and officers may be entitled by contract or otherwise.

Section 9.8 Forms of Indemnification Not Permitted. No indemnification or advance shall be made under this Article IX, except as provided in Section 9.4 or 9.5(b) of these Bylaws, in any circumstances where it appears:

(a) That it would be inconsistent with a provision of the Articles, these Bylaws, a resolution of the Member, or an agreement in effect at the time of the accrual of the alleged cause of action asserted in the proceeding in which the expenses were incurred or other amounts were paid, which prohibits or otherwise limits indemnification; or

(b) That it would be inconsistent with any condition expressly imposed by a court in approving a settlement.

Section 9.9 Insurance. This corporation shall have the power, and shall use its best efforts, to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any agent of this corporation against any liability asserted against or incurred by the agent in such capacity or arising out of the agent's status as such whether or not this corporation would have the power to indemnify the agent against such liability under the provisions of this Article IX, provided, however, that this corporation shall have no power to purchase and maintain such insurance to indemnify any agent of this corporation for a violation of Section 5233 of the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law.

Section 9.10 Nonapplicability to Fiduciaries of Employee Benefit Plans. This Article IX does not apply to any proceeding against any trustee, investment manager or other fiduciary of an employee benefit plan in such person’s capacity as such, even though such person may also be an agent of this corporation as defined in Section 9.1 of these Bylaws. This corporation shall have power to indemnify such trustee, investment manager, or other fiduciary to the extent permitted by subdivision (f) of Section 5140 of the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law.
