All individuals responsible for managing and investing Endaoment.org’s institutional funds must do so in good faith and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances. In making any decision relative to the management and investment of institutional funds, each of the following factors must be considered, and properly documented, in the minutes or other records of the applicable decision-making body:

1. 1.  
General economic conditions;

2. 2.  
Protocol security,

3. 3.  
Possible effect of inflation or deflation;

4. 4.  
Expected tax consequences, if any, of investment decisions or strategies;

5. 5.  
The role that each investment or course of action plays within the overall investment portfolio of the fund;

6. 6.  
Expected total return from the income and appreciation of investments;

7. 7.  
Other resources of the organization;

8. 8.  
The needs of the organization and the fund to make distributions and preserve capital; and,

9. 9.  
An asset’s special relationship or special value, if any, to the organization’s purposes.

## Guidelines for Investment

These guidelines are meant to inform the way that donated capital owned by Endaoment.org smart contracts ecosystem is invested. The investment goal is to achieve a stable return, while the optionality for donors to recommend investment into the digital asset industry over time. The following guidelines apply to all investment asset classes:

**Crypto Allowable Range**: Minimum 0% - Maximum 30% of total platform assets, per the following maximum macro asset allocations:

* 25.0% Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), or wrapped derivatives thereof, where the derivative is non-algorithmic and backed with a 1:1 ratio of native token reserves held in escrow: currently Rocket Pool ETH (rETH), Lido Staked ETH (stETH), and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC++).

* 5.0% Mission aligned crypto assets, as determined by the Board of Directors. Mission aligned crypto assets, for sake of balancing caps, can also include ETH, BTC, or wrapped derivatives thereof from the above category.

Mission aligned crypto assets are those that are considered to prioritize community engagement, transparency, and the public good. We recognize the transformative potential of decentralized systems and the role they can play in creating a more equitable and democratic onchain world. Therefore, we prioritize projects that value decentralization and are committed to building open and transparent systems that benefit all stakeholders. Our commitment to supporting projects that align with our values and have the potential to create positive change in fundamental in the decision making process related to inclusion in this list. We will continue to monitor developments in the cryptocurrency space and adjust our strategy accordingly to ensure that our investments remain in line with our mission.

Endaoment.org may hold any amount of USDC, or other USD pegged, non-algorithmic stable coins backed with a 1:1 ratio of fiat reserves held in escrow. Any amount of those USD-backed funds may also be deployed into money-market interest bearing USD pegged stable coins from yield protocols that meet the Board's published **Protocol Evaluation Criteria**.

## Enforcement of Guidelines

Endaoment.org will create **Deposit Caps** for each portfolio that effectively restrict its size on the platform in order to maintain conformity with the aforementioned guidelines. A **Deposit Cap** can be set at any level at or below what is permitted in accordance with the **Crypto Allowable Range** by the Endaoment.org staff, and are subject at any time without prior notice. All **Deposit Caps** will be publicly visible in the Endaoment.org UI.

Normal and expected market conditions can lead to investments falling outside of the **Crypto Allowable Range** (e.g. in the case of extreme growth of a portfolio's underlying asset). In the case that any portfolio's value leads to an investment falling outside of the **Crypto Allowable Range** the Board shall discuss remedies at their next quarterly Board meeting. Remedies may include but are not limited to adjusting the **Crypto Allowable Range** or force exiting any portion of any portfolio allocation.

## Protocol Evaluation Criteria

Only well-audited and tested crypto assets will be utilized for any Endaoment.org portfolio with the objective to seek stable growth consistent with current market conditions. While crypto assets don’t have ratings in the way traditional investment assets do, the Investment Committee and Management team are responsible for determining the quality of both the asset(s) themselves as well as the underlying protocol(s). Assets will only be considered for investment if their underlying protocol is a minimum of 6 months old, the underlying code is publicly accessible, and has undergone a security audit. All assets must be classified under the macro allocation allowances above per the asset’s character or type else they shall not be considered for use in portfolios.

No assets considered by Endaoment.org may utilize any form of leverage in order to achieve return or otherwise as part of its protocol. No leverage of any kind can be used for any crypto investment, either within or outside of portfolios.

In the case of mission aligned crypto assets, the committee should consider all of the above policies. In addition, they should consider portfolios for assets that are native to partner projects, or represent an alignment with the Organization's mission. Mission aligned assets should have an accompanying written rationale for its inclusion when adopted, and that rationale should be shared publicly with the Endaoment community through official channels.

## Donor Restrictions

In all instances, donor intent shall be respected when decisions are rendered concerning the investment of donor restricted funds when possible and not in conflict with internal policies. Endaoment.org retains full control of the funds and can, without notice to the donor, evacuate any investment position if it deems it to be unsafe, risky, or undesirable for any reason; provided, however, that if Endaoment.org accepts a particular gift subject to a lawful restriction on investments, it will comply with such restrictions.

## Crisis Response & Emergency Action

Endaoment.org retains the right to effectively change or convert any investment or holding within any fund or organization smart contract at any time, as a response to fluctuating market conditions.

Regardless of how well any particular asset is audited, vetted, researched, etc. there always remains an inherent risk in using any form of cryptocurrency. Stable coins can de-peg, onchain investments can become insolvent, derivatives backed with native token reserves held in escrow may fall below their ideal 1:1 ratio. With this basis of understanding, Endaoment.org will act swiftly in response to any such event or threat thereof. These actions may include but are not limited to evacuating any portfolio position on behalf of any fund or organization or removing any portfolio from access, migrating assets to different or newly deployed smart contracts, changing the base token of the platform, temporarily suspending activity via the UI, temporarily moving assets off-chain to to another chain, and other blockchain and fiat transactions meant to ensure the security of the platform and value of assets.
