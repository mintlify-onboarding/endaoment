The Community Foundation shall determine the grant recipients (“Recipients”) appropriate to receive grants made from the Fund with the advice from the partner organization(s) selected by the Community Foundation (“Partner(s)”) or from the community group from which the initial Donor or Donors to the Fund originated, whether or not such members are also Donors No Partner shall advise on selecting itself to be a Recipient of the Fund; provided, however, that the Community Foundation may itself make a grant from the Fund to a Partner not to exceed 10% of the value of the fund.

Subject to the right of the Community Foundation to reject any particular gift, any person whether an individual, corporation, trust, estate or organization may make additional gifts to the Community Foundation for the purposes of the Fund by a transfer to the Community Foundation of property acceptable to the Community Foundation in whole or in part for the Fund.

If any gifts to the Community Foundation for the purposes of the Fund are received and accepted subject to a donor's conditions or restrictions as to the use of the gift or income therefrom, said conditions or restrictions will be honored, subject, however, to the authority of the Board to vary the terms of any gift if continued adherence to any condition or restriction is in the judgment of the Board unnecessary, incapable of fulfillment or inconsistent with the charitable needs of the community served by the Community Foundation. No distribution shall be made from the Fund to any individual or entity if such distribution will in the judgment of the Community Foundation endanger the Community Foundation's Code Section 501(c)(3) status.

5\. **ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS** Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Community Foundation shall hold the Fund, and all contributions to the Fund, subject to the provisions of the applicable federal and relevant local laws and the Community Foundation's Bylaws and Articles of Incorporation.
