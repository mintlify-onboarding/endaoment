[Endaoment](http://app.endaoment.org) is a nonprofit community foundation & public charity built on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) blockchain, allowing anyone to donate their digital assets to any qualified 501(c)(3) U.S. nonprofit organization, and over 3500 international organizations thanks to Endaoment's relationship with US 501(c)(3) GlobalGiving.

## Our mission is to encourage and manage the charitable giving through emerging technologies.

We're a California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation, federally tax-exempt under IRS revenue code section 501(c)(3). All donations to Endaoment or and of Endaoment's Funds are tax-deductible to the fullest extent of the law.

You can create a Donor-Advised Fund (DAF) on using a social account or an Ethereum wallet [via our app](https://app.endaoment.org), [donate directly to any organization](https://app.endaoment.org/explore), and [join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/DHDyTGF) to ask questions and get involved in the community!

Endaoment is supported by [our amazing community](https://discord.gg/endaoment) of donors and nonprofit professionals. Our newly revamped onchain smart contracts have been audited by blockchain security consultants [LeastAuthority](https://leastauthority.com), and our application interfaces have been built to leverage services and tools native to Decentralized Finance. We'll continue to roll out more features that double-down on making a Community Foundation built for the DeFi community.
