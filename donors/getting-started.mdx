Endaoment currently offers two methods of making donations:

* **Making a** [**Direct Donation**](/donors/about-direct-donations) \- typically accomplished in a single step

* **Donating to a Fund** (either a [personal DAF](/donors/donor-advised-funds) or [Community Fund](/donors/community-funds)) - offers additional flexibility, but requires [some initial setup](/donors/getting-started/starting-a-fund)

Both processes allow donors to make tax-deductible donations of their crypto, as outlined below.

## [Donating Directly](/donors/getting-started/direct-donations)

To begin, [connect an Ethereum wallet](/donors/getting-started/connecting-your-wallet) to the [Endaoment App](https://app.endaoment.org) and choose the organization you wish to donate to.

We take care of the due diligence to make sure the donation is going directly to the organization either as US Dollars or [USDC](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc), depending on their preference.

## [Donating to a Fund](/donors/getting-started/making-a-donation)

First, [connect an Ethereum wallet](/donors/getting-started/connecting-your-wallet) to Endaoment, and [deploy a DAF contract](/donors/getting-started/starting-a-fund). You will need to provide some basic info about yourself, and cover the ETH transaction fees needed to deploy your fund's onchain smart contract.

Next, [fund your DAF with a donation of cryptocurrency](/donors/getting-started/making-a-donation). All gifts are an irrevocable donation to Endaoment and cannot be withdrawn or used for any other purpose besides grant-making to qualified 501(c)(3) charities.

Once you have a DAF set up, you can [make grant recommendations](/donors/getting-started/recommending-grants) to nonprofits of your choosing. We take care of the due diligence to make sure the grant is going directly to the organization either as US Dollars or [USDC](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc), depending on their preference.
