At Endaoment, we accept a diverse range of assets to facilitate your charitable giving and assist you on your philanthropic journey. This flexibility ensures that you can contribute in a manner that aligns with your financial situation and preferences, as donating assets in their original form is typically the most efficient means of donating and may yield a larger tax deduction\*.

Here's a breakdown of the assets we accept and how each process works:

## Gifted Asset: **Cash**

Cash donations are simple, straightforward, and take between 24-48 hours to complete based on the type of transfer. We accept cash transfers through either your credit card, payment app, or bank account:

### Credit Card Donations

* Donations via credit card are processed through Stripe.

* All major credit card providers are accepted:  
   * Visa  
   * MasterCard  
   * American Express  
   * Discover

### Payment Application Donations

* Donations via payment applications are processed through Stripe.

* Most major apps are supported:  
   * Apple Pay  
   * Google Pay  
   * Cash App Pay  
   * WeChat Pay

### Bank Account Donations

* Direct bank transfers are also processed via Stripe.

* Be aware that processing times may vary depending on whether the transfer method is an ACH payment or bank wire transfer.

**Cash: What to Expect:**

* [Fees vary](https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods) depending on the method of donation chosen; international transactions or transactions involving currency conversion cost extra.

* As you submit your donation transaction, we'll programmatically generate a tax receipt for you and send it via email if requested.

* Finally, we'll move the funds onto our platform as we receive them from the payment service provider and move them into the entity you indicated when issuing your donation.

## Gifted Asset: **Stock**

Stock donations allow you to support Endaoment with equity and can potentially lead to outsized tax deductions, as you may be able to deduct the Fair-Market Value (FMV) of the gifted asset if you've held that asset for longer than one year. As stock transfers are conducted through brokerages, donations of stock can take between 5-10 days to complete.

* Your stock donation is processed through our partners at The Giving Block and RenPSG.

* After completing the stock giving flow in the Endaoment application, paperwork will be sent to you as well as to your brokerage to initiate the transfer process.

* Upon receipt, your stock will be liquidated, and the proceeds will be granted to Endaoment as per your instructions.

**What to Expect:**

* As you submit your donation transaction, we'll programmatically generate a tax receipt for you and send it via email if requested.

* Finally, we'll move the funds onto our platform as we receive them from the payment service provider, and move them into the entity you indicated when issuing your donation.

## Gifted Asset: **Cryptocurrency**

Similar to stocks, cryptocurrency donations allow you to support Endaoment with onchain assets and can potentially lead to outsized tax deductions, as you may be able to [deduct the Fair-Market Value (FMV)](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p561.pdf) of the gifted asset if you've held that asset for longer than one year. As crypto transfers are near instantaneous, donations of crypto settle instantly if on an EVM compatible chain, and within 2-8 hours if on a non-EVM compatible chain. Donations of NFTs are handled uniquely as auctions are often required in order to liquidate the asset.

### Ethereum Mainnet and Base L2

* We accept a variety of EVM-compatible cryptocurrencies within our application, currently over 1000 different tokens across Ethereum Mainnet and Base L2.

* EVM-compatible cryptocurrency donations are exchanged for USDC on Uniswap at the moment of donation, and proceeds are granted to Endaoment as per your instructions.

### Other Cryptocurrencies and NFTs

* We accept most non-EVM-compatible cryptocurrencies and non ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum within our application using our donation wizard - this includes NFTs on Ethereum and other chains, Bitcoin, Cardano, Solana, Polygon, and Optimism, among others.

* Non-EVM-compatible cryptocurrency donations are exchanged for USDC on Coinbase or another centralized exchange shortly after the donation completes, and proceeds are granted to Endaoment as per your instructions.

* Donations of NFTs are each handled independently as we will seek to understand the donor's wishes as they relate to the auction we'll run to liquidate the NFT asset for USDC, usually conducted on OpenSea, ArtBlocks, or another reputable NFT auction house.

**What to Expect:**

* If donating EVM-compatible cryptocurrency, as you submit your donation transaction, we'll programmatically generate a tax receipt for you and send it via email if requested.

* If donating non-EVM-compatible cryptocurrency, the transaction receipt will be sent as the asset is liquidated, approximately 2-8 hours after it's been received.

* NFT donations are never associated with donation receipts as independent appraisals are needed in order to take a deduction for the donation of an NFT.

## Bespoke Gifts

For unique assets like property or time-based liquidation gifts (gifts associated with a unique selling schedule request), we work closely with donors on an individual basis to ensure a smooth donation process:

* As bespoke gifts require manual processing, please [get in touch](mailto:admin+donations@endaoment.org) so we can discuss the specifics of your desired gift and/or liquidation schedule as all gifts here are unique.

* Liquidation events can be time-based or triggered by another agreed-upon event, and usually are paired with donor agreements that discuss the specifics of any bespoke gifting experience.

Feel free to [contact us](mailto:admin+donations@endaoment.org) if you have any questions regarding asset acceptance or if you need assistance with a specific type of donation. Your generous contributions empower us to drive positive change through decentralized finance, and we are here to ensure that your giving experience is seamless and rewarding.
