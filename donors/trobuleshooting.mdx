Having trouble? Consult this list of common questions, but don't hesitate to be in touch.

For any urgent issues, please reach out to us by emailing [admin@endaoment.org](mailto:admin@endaoment.org) and we'll get back to you within 24 hours.

## I can't find a nonprofit organization, what should I do?

Some orgs have different names registered with the government than the name they do business under. If you know the organization's EIN # you can always navigate to it by visiting:

`app.endaoment.org/orgs/###EIN###`

If you do not know the organization's EIN # you can look it up on the [IRS's Tax Exempt Organization Search](https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/), or [be in touch](mailto:admin@endaoment.org) and we can help you figure things out.

## How do I donate an NFT?

We support all kinds of crypto asset donations, including donations of NFTs! For NFT donations, we ask that folks [get in touch](mailto:admin@endaoment.org) before making the donation so we can discuss details first.

## The token I want to donate isn't showing up.

We support most tokens with a [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org) exchange contract.

Don't see a token you'd like to donate? Email [admin@endaoment.org](mailto:admin@endaoment.org) and we'll be in touch with potential fixes.
