title: "About Direct Donations"
---

A direct donation is a straightforward gift made from your [connected wallet](/donors/getting-started/connecting-your-wallet) to a nonprofit organization via Endaoment's smart contract. This method bypasses the need to [establish](/donors/getting-started/starting-a-fund) a [Donor-Advised Fund (DAF)](/donors/donor-advised-funds).

With direct donations, your assets are sent to the chosen nonprofit in a single transaction. Often, you may be able to deduct the full value of your gift to offset taxable income, similar to the benefits offered through a [DAF](/donors/donor-advised-funds).\*

The process is akin to [donating to a fund](/donors/getting-started/making-a-donation): simply select the asset and amount, and indicate if you'd like to receive a tax receipt.

Select the asset, amount, and check the box if you'd like a tax receipt.

Direct Donations are channeled through the Endaoment Direct Donations Community Fund to the compliant 501(c)(3) nonprofit of your choice.\*\* This streamlines the tax deductibility of your gift and quickens the delivery time.

All direct donations must be **unrestricted gifts**. If you wish to place restrictions on your gift, you'll need to [create a DAF](/donors/donor-advised-funds).
