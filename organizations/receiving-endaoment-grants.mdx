title: "Receiving Endaoment Grants"
---

In order to get granted funds transferred to your 501(c)(3) organization, you'll need to claim your organization.

In order to claim your organization, you'll need to determine how you'd like to receive the funds. There are two options available for grant award delivery via U.S. Bank Wire and via USDC:

## via U.S. Bank Wire

This method does not involve the use of tools like a crypto wallet and doesn't require you to have a cryptocurrency balance.

All you'll need to do is navigate your organization's profile page and [submit a wire claim](https://docs.endaoment.org/organizations/claiming-an-organization/submitting-a-claim#wire-transfer) for your organization after locating it using the org search or navigating to your organization's page using its EIN:

`app.endaoment.org/orgs/###EIN###`

After claiming your organization, we'll transfer awarded dollars directly to your bank account.

Read our criteria for claiming and verifying your Organization: [Verification Policy](/governance/mission-values#enforcement-of-policy)

We'll need your contact information _(name, e-mail, and address)_ to process your claim of the organization. Once that is complete, we then need your banking information (_ABA routing number and account number_) in order to process the wire transfer. Wire transfers usually take about 2-4 business days.

From there, the funds will be in your bank account, ready to be spent on organizational needs.

## via USDC

USDC is a digital, tokenized form of the U.S. dollar on the Ethereum blockchain.

Using this option requires that you have an Ethereum wallet and requires that you have a small amount of Ether (ETH) in that wallet to cover transaction costs.

This method is preferred as it is faster, cheaper, and more straightforward. That said, it can be a bit confounding for newcomers to the DeFi space so please reach out if you have any questions.

Head to [Endaoment](http://app.endaoment.org) and [submit a claim](/organizations/claiming-an-organization/submitting-a-claim) for your organization after locating it using the org search or navigating to your organization's page using its EIN:
