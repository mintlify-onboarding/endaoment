Organizations can utilize Endaoment to fundraise around specific initiatives, sponsorships, or campaigns, and donors can give with greater precision towards the outcomes they feel are most important.

When viewing a nonprofit profile on the Endaoment App, sponsored projects are listed below the parent organization’s mission, as shown:

The sponsored projects section will only appear for linked orgs

Click on a project’s card to be directed to its dedicated profile page. From there donors can learn more about the project, and make a direct donation or grant from your DAF.

All funds flow to the sponsoring organization, inheriting its [bank wire](https://docs.endaoment.org/organizations/receiving-endaoment-grants#via-u.s.-bank-wire) or [wallet](https://docs.endaoment.org/organizations/receiving-endaoment-grants#via-usdc) claim, with special instructions that grants be directed towards the selected initiatives.

If you'd like to create a sponsored project for your org, please fill out [this form](https://endaoment.typeform.com/project) and we'll be in touch!
