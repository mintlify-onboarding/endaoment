## **Step 1: Claim your Organization**

To access funds granted to your organization, begin by [claiming your organization](/organizations/claiming-an-organization/submitting-a-claim) on [Endaoment](http://app.endaoment.org). Once claimed, we can proceed with transferring funds to your organization!

Find your organization on our platform using your IRS assigned EIN:

`app.endaoment.org/orgs/###EIN###`

## Step 2: Withdraw Granted Funds

With your organization claimed, you're now eligible to [withdraw any granted funds](/organizations/claiming-an-organization/using-a-bank-wire) approved by Endaoment. If you haven't received any grants yet, it's the perfect time to spread the word! Upon receiving grants, you have two withdrawal options:

1. 1.  
Opt for a wire transfer and receive funds directly deposited into your bank account as USD.

2. 2.  
Have the funds transferred to your organization's cryptocurrency wallet as [USDC](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc).
