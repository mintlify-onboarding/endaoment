## How long will it take to receive an approved grant?

All grants are transferred to either your organization's cryptocurrency wallet or via bank wire to your organization's bank account.

When transferred via crypto wallet, the granted amount moves almost instantly. For domestic bank wires, expect approximately a 24 hours wait time.

## How do I request a withdrawal of funds?

After claiming your organization, simply return to your organization's page and await approved grants.

If your contract has a balance to withdraw, it will show up on your organization's profile only when logged into Endaoment with the account used for the claim. We'll contact you with each approved grant and transfer funds shortly thereafter via your desired method.
