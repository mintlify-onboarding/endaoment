title: "About Endaoment"
---

[Endaoment](http://app.endaoment.org) is a new public charity that offers Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs) and Direct Donations to Non-Profits built atop the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) blockchain. We've created a crypto-native application that allows folks to seamlessly make donations of their crypto directly from their crypto-wallet.

**Our mission is to manage and encourage efficient charitable giving.**

We're focused on making the most secure and easy-to-use giving platform for both Donors and Organizations interested in Decentralized Finance.

Endaoment creates a dedicated Ethereum address for every nonprofit organization that receives a grant from one of our DAFs. Think of this address as an escrow account for holding grant awards until you're ready to move them elsewhere.
